            Tying it all together

            So lets start by including bootstraps library.
            To find out how to do that lets go to bootstraps website
            -->

    <!-- Here are are going to make some bootstrap items in HTML -->

    <section class="row">
        <!-- Let's start by making a card -->
        <!-- We give it a width with "col-4" a width of 4 columns -->
        <article class="col-4">

            <!-- It needs a class of "card" -->
            <div class="card">

                <!-- Let's add a "card-img-top" or image cap -->
                <img class="card-img-top" src="https://www.placecage.com/300/200" />

                <!-- Let's make a "card-header" -->
                <h3 class="card-header">Go back to your room</h3>

                <!-- Let's mark the "card-body" content -->
                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>I go where I want.</p>
                </div>

            </div>

        </article>

        <!-- Let's copy what we just did and make another one -->
        <!-- These 2 are stacking and we don't want that -->
        <!-- We want them to be `in a "row"` so lets put them
    `IN A "row"-->
        <article class="col-4">

            <!-- It needs a class of "card" -->
            <div class="card">

                <!-- Let's add a "card-img-top" or image cap -->

    <!-- This section will be where our JS places things -->
    <section class="row makeup-content">

    <!-- Including JS
            JS files go at the bottom, so that way we can put up
            a loading GIF, while the data loads.

            Here is how we include JS files
            <script src="[file location here]"></script>
            
            Here we are including the jquery library.
         -->

    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>

    <!-- Here we are including our JS file -->
    <script src="./main.js"></script>
